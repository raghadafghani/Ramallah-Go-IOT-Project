# 📚💡Ramallah-Go-IOT-Project🛒🌍

🛒 Purpose:
This project aims to create a realistic plan for the first Amazon Go store in Palestine, specifically in Ramallah. It is an educational endeavor and not meant to promote any particular company.

🛒 Quick Overview:
Amazon Go is a new kind of store where customers can shop without waiting in lines or using traditional checkouts. By using a mobile app, customers can shop at a physical store seamlessly. The first Amazon Go store opened in Seattle, USA. This concept relies on technologies like sensors, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and machine vision.

🛒 Project Focus:
This project focuses on exploring the use of Internet of Things (IoT) and security measures for the proposed Amazon Go store in Palestine. We want to design a comprehensive solution that combines IoT, AI, and security to create an efficient and secure shopping experience for customers in Iceland.
